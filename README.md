# -Simple-Facial-Recognition
OpenCV uses machine learning algorithms to search for faces within a picture. Making such algorithms that can detect faces.

STEPS:

Save the python file & the XLM in a new folder.

Get any photo (black & white or colored), you can use a photo with one or more faces and then save it in the folder you put the code & XLM file in.

The name of the photo you saved, add that name to the ImagePath. Save it once more and then run the code.
